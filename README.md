This repository contains a deep dive on Data Structures and Algorithms theory and concepts along with Python based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction and the Basics

### What is an Algorithm
Overall this is the most intuitive definition  of an algorithm:

* A set of instructions used to solved a problem
 
Outside of computing, one example of an algorithm can be a recipe from a cookbook to craft a meal. Where we follow a certain set of instruction from the cook book to create our meal, which would thus solve the problem of our hunger. 

### What is a Data Structure

* A data structure is a format for accessing, storing, organizing, or structuring data.

Overall it is a technique of how data can inter-relate to each other logically or mathematically. 

**The connection between algorithms and data structures is that an algorithm processes data and that data is then stored into a data structure.**
### Data Type

### Abstract Data Types (ADT)
*
**ADT gives us the blue print while a data structure tells us how to implement it**

### Big-O Notation
